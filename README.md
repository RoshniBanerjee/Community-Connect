My objective in teaching "Introduction to AI" at HIJLI HIGH School was to share my
passion for artificial intelligence and its potential to transform various sectors and everyday
life. During my visit, I delivered interactive lectures, and demonstrated practical AI
applications such as chatbots, image recognition, and basic machine learning models, aiming to
ignite curiosity and interest in technology among the students. These services were
complemented with access to online resources and materials for further exploration. I chose
this organization because of my commitment to educational equity and my desire to provide
every student with the opportunity to engage with advanced technological concepts, regardless
of their socio-economic background. West Bengal Government High School serves a diverse
student population, making it an ideal environment to foster inclusive education and bridge the
digital divide. By bringing AI education to these students, I hoped to contribute to their holistic
development and inspire them to pursue careers in STEM fields, thereby preparing them for a
future driven by technological advancements
